## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
 
Geeksforgeeks: functionality and meaning of some HTML keywords

Tutorialspoint: displaying an image on a button onclick

StackOverflow: displaying an image on a button onclick

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The first challenge I encountered in creating this submission was that I initially thought I had to entirely come up with my own codes for this submission. I overcame this by following more links on the instructions page and reading the steps.  The second challenge I encountered was that when I tried to add a show() function to script.js and use it to display an image on the buttons onclick, the image appeared on the page instead of appearing on the button which was not what I wanted. I overcame this by using the background-image feature of CSS, which was a lot easier. I also adjusted the sizes of the images because they were too large. The other challenge I faced was pushing my project to GitHub. I at first tried using GitHub desktop but it was hard for me to follow up with the steps because for some reason, GitHub desktop was taking longer to load for me.  Secondly, I using the export feature of Glitch which worked well, but the problem was that I had written my reflection responses on the GitHub READme file before I pushed my project to GitHub. When I pushed it, everything I had written disappeared and I had to start all over again. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

After completing the simple light and sound game project, I became more curious about web development . I want to know and become more familiar with using a lot more different features of CSS and HTML. I also want to know how to use javascript better and create logically accurate and productive algorithms and solutions to a variety of problems. I am also curious to know how to use other programming languages such as java or C++ in combination with HTML and CSS for web development. Additionally, I want to know how to use HTML, CSS and javascript  to create more complex games. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours, I would add more features to the game. I would redefine the guess(btn) function to give the player more than one chance before failing the game.  I would make a way for the guesses and players to be tracked on the page instead of the console window. I would also make the game sound more complex than a single tone. I also wanted to make the computer choose a different pattern each time the game is played.
